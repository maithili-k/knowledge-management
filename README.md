# Managing the knowledge databse

**How do we handle all the user requests, problems reported and their solutions, keep track of it all and share with everyone?**

As a first step, in these pages I will form a knowledge database. We do have the ticketing system, but given that the solution often lies somewhere different than the question from the user, keyword search can yield too many results. Also, you may not even know what keyword search for (particularly for newbies). We can rely on the good memory of our colleagues, but is not the ideal solution. Also grid is statically dynamic and dynamically static, so manuals and documentation that may point in the right direction can be hard to come by. 

The database will help us to identify the following:

1. What problems occur often and how do we resolve them?

2. Do we always offer a standard solution or it varies?

3. Which problems were never fully resolved?

4. What can we do about the unresolved problems?

5. What is obsolete and what is new?

6. How do we exchange knowledge?

7. How can we make the whole process of problem-solving and knowledge-exchange smoother?

We all went through a steep learning curve when we started learning about the grid. The better we understood and as our knowledge database
expanded, it became easier to resolve problems. If all the information is logged, this process can be made smoother and efficient. 
Given the changing size of the group - additions as well as subtractions, a groogle (grid google) could come in handy. 
(After coining the term found out what it actually means - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=groogle)

In these pages, I will segregate the reported problems (addressing the first 3 points above) and we take it from there. We can eventually resort
to a tooling system (e.g., PUR, etc.) There are tools also being considered SURFsara wide, which as I undersatnd will be tested over the coming weeks (Markus,
what was the name of that tool Jeroen E. mentioned?). To evaluate the usability of these, or any tool for that matter, we must first identify the type of problems we face and our workflow for resolving them. 

If we don't see a solution from these tooling systems (ones under consideration at the moment) in the near future (I say in 2 months) we shall explore other tools (suggestions welcome!). These 2 months will give me time to accumulate the information on a variety of problems and ensure all are categorized after taking inputs from the grid team.
